#### By Sarah Angel

## Description

This is a form website using JavaScript, HTML, JQuery, and CSS for styling. It is a practice exercise for the week 8 personal project. It determines a vacation destination based on simple comparating operators.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository.
* Open HTML file


## Known Bugs

I wanted to flow the information more logically through the operators but it got really complicated so I kept the operators simple. Because of this, it might be more frequent you get India or Hawaii than Paris.
